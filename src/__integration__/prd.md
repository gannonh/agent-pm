# TaskFlow: AI-Powered Task Management System

## Project Overview
TaskFlow is a modern task management application that uses AI to help users organize, prioritize, and complete their work more efficiently. The system analyzes user behavior patterns, task dependencies, and completion history to provide intelligent suggestions for task prioritization and time management. TaskFlow aims to solve the problem of productivity loss due to poor task organization and the cognitive load of constantly reprioritizing work.

## Goals
- Create an intuitive, cross-platform task management system with web, mobile, and desktop interfaces
- Implement AI-powered task prioritization that learns from user behavior
- Provide intelligent time estimation based on historical task completion data
- Enable seamless collaboration features for team task management
- Integrate with popular productivity tools (Google Calendar, Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Ensure data privacy and security while leveraging AI capabilities

## Stakeholders
- Individual professionals seeking better personal productivity tools
- Remote and hybrid teams needing collaborative task management
- Project managers who need to track team progress and workloads
- Enterprise customers requiring secure, scalable task management solutions
- Product and engineering teams building and maintaining the platform

## Technologies
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript for web interface
- Mobile: React Native for iOS and Android applications
- Backend: Node.js with Express and GraphQL API
- Database: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- AI/ML: TensorFlow for recommendation engine and task analysis
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with multi-factor authentication
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Cloud: AWS for hosting and scalability

## Constraints
- Must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data privacy regulations
- Initial release timeline of 6 months to market
- Budget constraints requiring efficient resource allocation
- Must work offline with synchronization when connectivity is restored
- API rate limits for third-party integrations
- Must be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
